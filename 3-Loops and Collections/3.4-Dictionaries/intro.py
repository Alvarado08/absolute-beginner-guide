# Dictionaries in Python act as containers storing data as key-value pairs
# Keys are unique and immutable, values can be of any type
# Dictionaries are defined using curly braces

# Example of a dictionary
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Accessing values in a dictionary
print(person["name"])
